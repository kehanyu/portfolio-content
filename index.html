		<p>Shanghai is one of the 4 major cities in China and it's the largest and richest 
            and one of the worlds most populated cities. This huge city is located on the 
            east coast of China and is a financial hub and home to the worlds busiest 
            container port. Shanghai has a futuristic skyline that overlooks colonial-style 
            buildings. There are many areas of Shanghai to explore, and the city has a huge 
            food scene from high-end to more budget-friendly eats. This Shanghai city guide 
            covers all of the top sights and attractions to see, what neighbourhoods to explore 
            in the city and what and where to eat, as well as some travel tips.</p>

		<p>The best way to get round Shanghai is by metro and shared bicycles. 
            Shanghai has one of the most robust metro systems in the world, and it
            is both affordable and convenient. However, some of the stations are built 
            a little far away from the attractions. In such case, you will need to take
            a shared bicycle, just like everyone else in the city, to get from the metro 
            station to the place you want to visit.</p>
